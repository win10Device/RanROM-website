_Duino-coin webminer/website monetizer_

Tired of showing users ads? Don't want to leak personal info to use Adsense? Use **Duinotize**! It's a fork of the official Duino-coin web miner designed to be easily integrated into any website, to generate passive income just from people visiting your website.

## Installation
Include the main script in your head element:
```html
<script src="https://NoozSBC.github.io/Duinotize/duinotize.js" defer></script>
```

Next make a script element add pass it an options object:
```html
<script>
  Duinotize({
    username: "nooz",
    rigid: "PersonalSite"
  });
</script>
```

Make sure to replace `nooz` with your DUCO username and `PersonalSite` with the name you want miners to show up as in the web wallet.

<details><summary>Optional configs</summary>
These are configurations you can change if you wish, but the script will run fine if you don't use them</br>
- <code>difficulty</code> variable with a mining difficulty of either "LOW", "MEDIUM", or "EXTREME" (LOW is the reccomended default, MEDIUM or EXTREME causes frequent socket disconnects and will get your account banned)</br>
- <code>`threads`</code> variable, to choose how many threads the miner uses. Anything over 1 could cause lag on some devices, and even prevent the website from loading on them</br>
- <code>`hasher`</code> variable, to choose which hasher to use. You can choose `DUCO-S1` or `hashwasm`. `hashwasm` has a extremely low hashrate on some devices, but a very high hashrate on others. `DUCO-S1` is the default and reccomended hasher.</br>

For example, a custom config might look like this:
```html
<script src="https://NoozSBC.github.io/Duinotize/duinotize.js" defer></script>
<script>
  Duinotize({
    username: "rpinews",
    rigid: "GameSite",
    difficulty: "LOW",
    threads: 2,
    hasher: "hashwasm"
  });
</script>
```
</details>

Now, whenever that page is opened, the miner will start and output messages to the developer console as a Service Worker. It will run until the whole tab (not just the specific page) is closed. Make sure to install the miner on a page where users visit the most, so that there are more miners running. You can see this in action at https://NoozSBC.github.io/Duinotize/demo/, or look [here](https://github.com/NoozSBC/Duinotize/blob/main/demo/index.html) for the source code to that page for a example of how to implement it.

I HIGHLY reccomend you put a note somewhere on your website to tell visiters that there is a crypto miner running in the background (in some regions it is illegal to mine crypto in the background without consent!), and optionally credit this repo.

## Troubleshooting
- The script isn't running for some users!
- - That user could have some browser extension which blocks service workers --> Get them to disable the entension on your site 
- - Their browser blocks external javascript files from being run -> Copy this repo as a folder to your site root and point the script URL to that file (eg. `<script src="scripts/duinotize/duinotize.js" defer></script>`)
    
## How it works
The program runs a wrapper, which parses the input and runs a worker that connects to the Duco server via a websocket, requests a mining job with the configured settings and solves it using either [DUCO-S1](https://github.com/mobilegmYT/Duinotize/blob/main/hashes.js) or [hash-wasm](https://github.com/Daninet/hash-wasm).The miner sends the result, the time it took, username and hashrate to the server which loads it onto your wallet.

## Credits
This project is a fork/continuation of https://github.com/VatsaDev/Mineuino as the original author seems to have abandoned it and the code is broken.
Thanks to LDarki from the Duino discord for helping with some of the code.

## Notes
- I made this in just 2 hours at 1AM, so if there are bugs PLEASE report them
- I also have never touched JS before, so if there are improvements that could be made to the code, please PR them in.
